# sapper-template

A [Sapper](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper) and [Spectre.css](https://picturepan2.github.io/spectre/) template with SASS integration for custom theming


## Getting started


### Using `degit`

[`degit`](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) is a scaffolding tool that lets you create a directory from a branch in a repository. Use either the `rollup` or `webpack` branch in `sapper-template`:

```bash
# for Rollup
npx degit "gevera/sapper-spectrecss-template#rollup" my-app
```


### Running the project

Once you get the code, you can install dependencies and run the project in development mode with:

```bash
cd my-app
npm install # or yarn
npm run dev
```

Open up [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and start clicking around.

Consult [sapper.svelte.dev](https://sapper.svelte.dev) for help getting started.
See [Spectre.css](https://picturepan2.github.io/spectre/) for CSS

### Customize Spectre theme
In `/static/styles/` folder edit theme.scss
Add Spectre.css vriables and tweak them to your liking

#### Enjoy!
